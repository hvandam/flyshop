Contains all code and doc for a fly fishing store web application - a learning and demo project.

##Overall project goals:
This is a learning project.  The fundamental goal is to learn current web 2.0 technologies and demonstrate skill in using them on a real project.

1.  Research current popular technologies.
2.  Choose technologies that are robust, popular with the developer community and well supported, and 
3.  Implement a real web application using them, not some toy app, but one I would use if I were going to start a fly fishing online business.
4.  Explore current testing practices for web applications, from a developer point of view.
5.  Use the Amazon AWS cloud to deploy the application, learning the tools and techniques of the cloud environment.

##Primary technologies for this project:
1.  Node.js
2.  express.js
3.  MySQL
4.  Angular.js
5.  HTML 5 /  CSS
6.  AWS cloud development

##Secondary technologies/goals for this project:
1. Add a NoSQL database to the project if there is a good design reason, to understand noSQL technologies better.
2. Gain more experience with GIT/GitHub.

##Goals for the web application:
1.  Learn the architecure, techniques and idioms of node.js, express.js and angular.js.
2.  Create a full featured web app (eventually) that could be used by a real business.  This will require many incremental feature releases.
3.  Use an agile approach, adding small features frequently. 
4.  Support an evolving design, looking ahead to possible enhancements and changes in functionality.
5.  Document the code written using best practices for js web code.
